# Bike Sharing Dashboard 🚲

## 📌 Project Overview

This Bike Sharing Dashboard is designed to visualize and analyze bike rental patterns based on various factors such as time, season, working days, and weather conditions. Built using Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the dashboard provides an interactive and insightful way to explore trends in bike usage.

This project is part of my learning journey in Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python from Dicoding. As part of the course, I was tasked with developing a comprehensive data analysis project, where I applied data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Through this project, I enhanced my ability to process real-world data, identify trends, and present findings effectively using Python.

## ✨ Features
✅ Total Rentals Analysis – Displays total bike rentals within a selected time range.

✅ Peak vs. Off-Peak Hours – Categorizes hours into Peak, Off-Peak, and Normal based on rental frequency.

✅ Working Day & Holiday Analysis – Analyzes rentals on working days, holidays, and non-working non-holidays.

✅ Rentals by Windspeed – Groups rentals based on different windspeed levels.

✅ Rentals by Time Category – Classifies rentals into Late Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.

✅ Seasonal Trends – Shows rental trends across different seasons.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the Bike Sharing Dataset, which contains:
- Hourly Data (hour.csv)
- Daily Data (day.csv)

## Results & Insights
📌 Peak Hours: Rentals are highest during morning and evening rush hours.

📌 Seasonal Trends: Fall and Summer have the highest rentals, while Winter has the lowest.

📌 Weather Impact: Rentals decrease as windspeed increases.

📌 Working Days vs. Holidays: Rentals are higher on working days compared to holidays.
